Hi 👋 My name is **Gengyan (Kyan) Tang [Chinese:唐耕砚]**. Here is [my latest CV](CV-Gengyan.pdf). I am a dedicated researcher in the fields of research integrity, academic integrity, and scholarly publishing. 

## Research Interests

My research interests include exploring the impact of artificial intelligence tools on research integrity, the role of news media in integrity education, and how complex adaptive educational leadership addresses systemic challenges in academic integrity. My papers are primarily published in the *Accountability in Research*.

## Social Media

In 2021, I founded the WeChat Offical Account *Journal Observer*(期刊观察). From time to time, I have been sharing profound research findings on scholarly publishing, sociology of science and scientometrics in the *Journal Observer*. As of 15 Aug 2023, the *Journal Observer* had 3,933 subscribers, with an average of 800 reads per article.
