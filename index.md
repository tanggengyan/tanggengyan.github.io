# About Me

<img src="1664867172379.jpg" class="floatpic" width="480" height="480">

Hi 👋 My name is **Gengyan Tang(唐耕砚)**. Here is [my latest CV](CV-Gengyan.pdf). 
 I am a master student in Journalism at Sichuan Academy of Social Sciences(China).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on ethical issues in scholarly publishing, and I’m particularly interested in the topics of inclusion, equity, transparency, diversity in scholarly publishing. In my master’s dissertation and published papers, I explored the issues of pervading individualism in the academic community and how academic tournaments result in the predatory journals.

## Social Media

In 2021, I founded the WeChat Offical Account *Journal Observer*(期刊观察). From time to time, I have been sharing profound research findings on scholarly publishing, sociology of science and scientometrics on the *Journal Observer*. As of 1 Feb 2023, the *Journal Observer* had 2,700 subscribers, with an average of 400 reads per article.
