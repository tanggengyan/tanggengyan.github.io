# About Me

<img src="1664867172379.jpg" class="floatpic" width="480" height="480">

Hi 👋 My name is **Gengyan (Kyan) Tang [Chinese name:唐耕砚]**. I am an incoming PhD student in the Werklund School of Education at the University of Calgary. Here is [my latest CV](CV-Gengyan.pdf). I currently serves as a peer reviewer for academic journals such as *Accountability in Research*, *Journal of Scholarly Publishing*, *Journal of Librarianship and Information Science*, and *BMC Medical Education*. I am also a student member of the Research Integrity and Responsible Innovation Professional Committee under the Chinese Association of Science of Science and S&T Policy Research. Additionally, I am the founder of the Chinese academic media *Journal Observer*, which publishes news on publishing ethics and research integrity. I also founded *The Digest Journal of Scholarly Publishing*, a bimonthly abstract journal that publishes outstanding papers on scholarly publishing, research integrity, academic integrity, and information science. 

## Research Interests

My research interests include research integrity, academic integrity, scholarly publishing, and higher education. Prior to my studies at the UCalgary, I lived in mainland China, where I was deeply concerned about the increasingly serious issue of research integrity, especially in the field of medicine, and has published some related papers.

## Social Media

In 2021, I founded the WeChat Offical Account *Journal Observer*(期刊观察). From time to time, I have been sharing profound research findings on research integrity, scholarly publishing, and academic integrity in the *Journal Observer*. As of 3 Jan. 2024, the *Journal Observer* had 5,000 subscribers, with an average of 800 reads per article.
