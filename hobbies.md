# Hobbies

## Photography

Photography is my way of capturing the magic in everyday life. I cherish the ability to freeze fleeting moments—those bursts of joy, quiet reflections, and unexpected beauty—and preserve them forever. It’s not just about documenting my experiences; it’s about sharing these stories with others, hoping to spread a little happiness, inspire wonder, and remind people of the beauty that surrounds us, even in the smallest things. For me, every click of the shutter is a way to connect, to tell a story, and to celebrate the extraordinary within the ordinary.

### 2024 in Calgary, Canada

In August 2024, I moved to Calgary. It all felt like a dream. Before this, I had never imagined that I would have the chance to study and live in another country. Calgary's summers and autumns are breathtaking, especially on the way to Banff. I love watching the sunlight spill over the mountains, making them look like jade adorned with gold. Winter in Calgary is bitterly cold, but to someone from the south like me, the snow is still nothing short of beautiful.

### 2021-2024 in Chongqing, China

I’ve spent four unforgettable years living in Chongqing, moving from Bishan to Jiulongpo District. Every flower, every tree in this city feels like an old friend. What captivates me the most are the bold, flavorful cuisine and the city’s unique, rugged terrain. But springtime is when Chongqing truly steals my heart—bougainvillea vines burst into bloom, draping every corner like a vibrant embrace, as if the city itself is sowing seeds of beauty in the hearts of its people.

### 2014-2020 in Chengdu, China

I completed both my undergraduate and master's programs in Chengdu, a city rich in cultural heritage. If you ever visit, you’ll understand why so many scholars and poets throughout Chinese history were drawn to this place. What I love most, though, is Qingcheng Mountain, located not far from the city. Its tranquil environment makes it my go-to retreat to refresh my spirit. As the birthplace of Taoism in China, Qingcheng Mountain has a unique energy that brings an incredible sense of peace every time I visit.

### 1995-2014 in Fushun, China

Fushun is the place where I grew up, spending the first 18 years of my life there. While my high school experience left much to be desired (I blame it on a "bad apple" education system), my elementary and middle school years were filled with joy and happiness. I still vividly remember running along the banks of the Tuojiang River, catching fish, dragonflies, and butterflies. My friends and I laughed loudly, played around, and dreamed about the future on the school playground. Fushun is an indelible part of who I am, etched into me as deeply as its every corner is imprinted in my memory.

## My Cat

This is my cat, Mimi. He’s 3 years old now, soon turning 4, and weighs 5 kilograms. Mimi came into my life during one of my most anxious and challenging times. Back then, I was coping with the loss of both my grandmother and great-grandmother, along with the disappointment of failing to secure a spot in a PhD program. Mimi became a tremendous source of emotional support for me. Right now, my mom is taking care of him, but once I finish my studies, I plan to bring him to live by my side.
