## Photography

I love photography and recording life. I want to record every wonderful moment and share it to bring happiness to all people.

### 2024 CALGARY

In August 2024, I moved to Calgary. It all felt like a dream. Before this, I had never imagined that I would have the chance to study and live in another country. Calgary's summers and autumns are breathtaking, especially on the way to Banff. I love watching the sunlight spill over the mountains, making them look like jade adorned with gold. Winter in Calgary is bitterly cold, but to someone from the south like me, the snow is still nothing short of beautiful.



### 2024 CHONGQING

I’ve spent four unforgettable years living in Chongqing, moving from Bishan to Jiulongpo District. Every flower, every tree in this city feels like an old friend. What captivates me the most are the bold, flavorful cuisine and the city’s unique, rugged terrain. But springtime is when Chongqing truly steals my heart—bougainvillea vines burst into bloom, draping every corner like a vibrant embrace, as if the city itself is sowing seeds of beauty in the hearts of its people.
